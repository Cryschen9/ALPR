Prerequisites for running the program:-

Python 3
OpenCV 3
MongoDB (only for storing the results in database).
Tensorflow
Python 3 libraries for ML algorithms

*I would recommend using Anaconda Package Manager which already comes required libraries except OpenCV and TensorFlow.
Install them separately.


Open the CNN folder and run "process.py" file in tensorflow environment.
To run the code on a single car image only execute the "main.py" file.
